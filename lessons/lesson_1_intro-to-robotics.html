            <h2>What's a Robot?</h2>
            <p>
                Before we begin we should define exactly what a robot is. The official definition is <i>any device that carries out tasks semi or fully autonomously</i>. So by definition, an air conditioning unit is technically a robot, which might seem absurd if you compare it to something like Boston Dynamics humanoid, Atlas, which fits its more classical picture. However as you'll come to see, a lot of what can be applied to simpler devices and systems can be used to explain robots!
            </p>

            <p>
                A more apt description would be that a robot is a physical device (or entity) that moves throughout the world and helps humans to more efficiently perform a task, or perform a task that a human couldn't on its own. 
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="extended-caption">
                <i>Did you know? Moravec's Paradox states that what is easy for a human to accomplish is difficult for a robot, and vice versa. 
                For instance, it would be extremely easy for you to reach into your pockets and pull out your wallet 
                adrift between other items like your phone or keys, but that seemingly simple task is currently beyond 
                the current abilities of even the most advanced robotic/AI systems. Contrarily, a giant robotic arm 
                in an automobile factory can effortlessly pick up the chassis of an entire car and move it to a 
                different assembly line, which is something that would require multiple humans and most definitely 
                induce cardiac arrest in an OSHA rep.</i>
            </p>
            <h2>Where's a Robot?</h2>

            <p>
                Now that we know what a robot is, where are they? Currently, robots can be found in industrial automation, healthcare, agriculture, and are expected to infiltrate other areas as well sooner or later (good thing you're getting involved with robots now, when they eventually gain sentience and rebel you might be spared if you already have a positive relationship with them).

            <h2>Who are the Robots?</h2>

            <p> 
                Despite the widespread appeal, there aren't that many robotics companies, at least compared to the number of AI B2B SaaS startups, but the number of businesses and industries adopting automation is rising exponentially. Some prominent robotics companies include Boston Dynamics (of humanoid and doge robot notoriety), iRobot (Roomba), and Waymo (autonomous cars are in fact a type of robot!). 

            </p>
            
            <p>
                So what do people who work with robots actually do? The actual answer to that question is a bit complex - there really aren't that many people who are full-on 'robotics' engineers or roboticists, and for a good reason. Robotics is a vast field and the combination of multiple traditional engineering disciplines, and it's important to keep in mind that robots aren't built by a single person - they are the product of hundreds or thousands of people working together simultaneously. That shouldn't scare you - as I'm trying to get across in this series, you don't need to be the smartest person to work with robots; if you have great communication skills and know some fundamentals, you'll be fine!
            </p>

            <p>
                Back to the different areas of robotics. Most would argue that the field is split into 3 major disciplines - mechanical, electrical, and software, though many roles in robotics might engage with more than one.

                        The mechanical side involves the physical structures and mechanisms that enable robots to interact with the environment. Much of this involves things called actuators. An <b>actuator</b> is a device that converts energy into physical motion, basically the part that moves (the muscles of the robot). The most common form of actuator would be any type of electric motor. For instance, motors on a drone spin really fast so that the propellers rotate fast enough to achieve lift. Mechanical engineers might spend their time designing the physical structure of the robot, as well as the pieces that engage with the actuators/motors to bring everything together.

                        Software entails writing code to perceive, plan, and execute tasks autonomously or under human guidance - essentially the logic the robot uses to do stuff. This may seem straightforward, but scope of it is vast - one software engineer might work on high-level planning algorithms to tell a robot to "do this when you see this", while another might work on low-level 'firmware' to ensure the hardware and software coordinate with one another optimally. These levels are what's called the 'software stack', or a layered framework of software components to enable a robot to 'think'.

                        Electrical bridges the gap between the mechanical and software components of robotics, acting as the nervous system that powers and connects everything. Electrical engineers ensure the robot's sensors, actuators, and control systems are all properly powered and communicate effectively. This involves designing circuits to distribute power from batteries or other energy sources, wiring sensors so they can send data to the robot's "brain," and ensuring motors receive the precise signals they need to move. Back in our drone example, the electrical components control the speed of the motors based on input from the software, allowing the drone to lift off and stay stable. Working on the electrical side means managing the flow of power and information, ensuring the hardware and software can function together seamlessly.

            <p>
                From basic automated devices like a toaster to advanced humanoid robots, the same fundamental principles apply—mechanical, electrical, and software systems working together in harmony to bring a robot to life. As you'll learn throughout this series, understanding how these systems interact is not only essential for mastering the technical aspects of robotics but also for effectively collaborating with others in the field.
